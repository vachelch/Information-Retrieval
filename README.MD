# Information Retrieval
Information Retrieval (IR) at NTU 2018 Spring. This repo includes hard codes of projects in the IR course, NTU. Codes shown here include:

	* Vector Space Model

## How to Run
According to the agreement, I am unable to release the data. You may find `execute.sh` in each diectory. It will tell something like this:
```bash
python3 predict.py --input_file=<ipt_file> --output_file=<opt_file> --model_dir=<model_dir> <param1> <param2>...
```
